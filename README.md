    <p class="text">My first trip to the dolphinarium was in the summer of 2010. Then I saw dolphins from a short distance and I was especially struck by their friendliness. They seem to strive for communication with a person. The language of dolphins is very expressive and somewhat similar to ours. They are emotional, mobile, love to play with each other and with people. My first trip to the dolphinarium was in the summer of 2010.
